					<h4>Longfin Smelt (<i>Spirinchus thaleichthys</i>) Ecology</h4>
					<p>Movement and migration patterns between water year types</p>
				</header>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://jonathonkuntz.github.io/images/longfin.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Longfin Smelt (pictured left) primarily follows a 2-year life cycle, is anadromous (i.e., migrating up rivers to spawn), and is a euryhaline (i.e., able to tolerate wide range of salinities) fish. Depending on the water year type and corresponding freshwater outflow in the San Francisco Estuary, individuals will migrate out to higher salinity waters (i.e., ocean) as they mature through their first year and subsequently return anually to fresher water until ready to spawn. However, it is still not understood whether the majority of indivduals follow the same and/or different life history patterns or if there is variation in migratory behaviour between different year classes. To help answer this question, I have been working with colleagues at the Universty of California Davis' Otolith Geochemistry and Fish Ecology Laboratory (OGFL). Our work focusses on using otoliths (i.e., ray finned fish ear stones), which grow daily layers similar to tree rings, in combination with a Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (LA-ICPMS) to track strontium stable isotope ratios from birth to death. These strontium stable isotope ratios can then be correlated to the salinity experienced throughout the fish's life. This project is ongoing.</p>
