					<h4>Leopard Shark (<i>Triakis semifasciata</i>) Ecology</h4>
					<p>Stable isotope food web and movement ecology across space and time</p>
				</header>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://jonathonkuntz.github.io/images/tooth.jpg" alt="" /></span>Stable isotope ecology follows the age old saying, “You are what you eat.” When animals consume their prey, the chemistry (i.e., stable isotopic ratios) of the prey gets incorporated into the predator’s tissues. This flow path of chemistry is radiated up through the food web, eventually getting to sharks at the mesopredator (i.e., middle trophic) and apex predator (i.e., top trophic) levels. Using stable isotopes in chronological tissues types (e.g., teeth, vertebrae, and eye lenses), I study Leopard Shark ecology across seasons and entire lifetimes in the heavily polluted San Francisco Estuary. My main goal of this project is to investigate whether effluent from the 38 wastewater treatment facilities in the San Francisco Estuary is affecting Leopard Shark dietary and migratory behaviors.</p>

					<h4>Longfin Smelt (<i>Spirinchus thaleichthys</i>) Ecology</h4>
					<p>Movement and migration patterns between water year types</p>
				</header>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://jonathonkuntz.github.io/images/longfin.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Longfin Smelt (pictured left) primarily follows a 2-year life cycle, is anadromous (i.e., migrating up rivers to spawn), and is a euryhaline (i.e., able to tolerate wide range of salinities) fish. Depending on the water year type and corresponding freshwater outflow in the San Francisco Estuary, individuals will migrate out to higher salinity waters (i.e., ocean) as they mature through their first year and subsequently return anually to fresher water until ready to spawn. However, it is still not understood whether the majority of indivduals follow the same and/or different life history patterns or if there is variation in migratory behaviour between different year classes. To help answer this question, I have been working with colleagues at the Universty of California Davis' Otolith Geochemistry and Fish Ecology Laboratory (OGFL). Our work focusses on using otoliths (i.e., ray finned fish ear stones), which grow daily layers similar to tree rings, in combination with a Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (LA-ICPMS) to track strontium stable isotope ratios from birth to death. These strontium stable isotope ratios can then be correlated to the salinity experienced throughout the fish's life. This project is ongoing.</p>
