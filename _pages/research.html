					<h4>Leopard Shark (<i>Triakis semifasciata</i>) Ecology</h4>
					<p>Stable isotope food web and movement ecology across space and time</p>
				</header>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://jonathonkuntz.github.io/images/tooth.jpg" alt="" /></span>Stable isotope ecology follows the age old saying, “You are what you eat.” When animals consume their prey, the chemistry (i.e., stable isotopic ratios) of the prey gets incorporated into the predator’s tissues. This flow path of chemistry is radiated up through the food web and is eventually incorprated into sharks at the mesopredator (i.e., middle) and apex predator (i.e., top) trophic levels. Using chronological tissues types (e.g., teeth, vertebrae, and eye lenses) which record multiple stable isotope timepoints across the individual's lifetime, I study Leopard Shark ecology sesonally and from birth to death in the heavily polluted San Francisco Estuary. My main goal of this project is to investigate whether effluent from the 38 wastewater treatment facilities in the San Francisco Estuary is affecting Leopard Shark dietary and migratory behaviors. This project is still ongoing.</p>

					<p>Long term monitoring of San Francisco Estuary Population</p>
				</header>
				<p><span class="image right"><img src="https://jonathonkuntz.github.io/images/JK_Boat2.jpg" alt="" /></span>Long-term monitoring is an extremely useful scientific tool to understand how species' populations are changing through space and time. Using long-term monitoring data, I am modeling Leopard Shark population decline in the critically important nursery habitat of the San Francisco Estuary. In addition to population variation, I am also modeling how the species is responding to climate change and corresponding changes to abiotic conditions along a macro estuarine gradient. This project is still ongoing.</p>

					<h4>Longfin Smelt (<i>Spirinchus thaleichthys</i>) Ecology</h4>
					<p>Movement and migration patterns between water year types</p>
				</header>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="https://jonathonkuntz.github.io/images/longfin.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Longfin Smelt (pictured left) primarily follows a 2-year life cycle, is anadromous (i.e., migrating up rivers to spawn), and is a euryhaline (i.e., able to tolerate wide range of salinities) fish. Depending on the water year type and corresponding freshwater outflow in the San Francisco Estuary, individuals will migrate out to higher salinity waters (i.e., ocean) as they mature through their first year and subsequently return anually to fresher water until ready to spawn. However, it is still not understood whether the majority of indivduals follow the same and/or different life history patterns or if there is variation in migratory behaviour between different year classes. To help answer this question, I have been working with a collaborative team at the Universty of California Davis' Otolith Geochemistry and Fish Ecology Laboratory (OGFL). Our work focusses on using otoliths (i.e., ray finned fish ear stones), which grow daily layers similar to tree rings, in combination with a Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (LA-ICPMS) to track strontium stable isotope ratios from birth to death. These strontium stable isotope ratios can then be correlated to the salinity experienced throughout the fish's life. This project is ongoing.</p>
