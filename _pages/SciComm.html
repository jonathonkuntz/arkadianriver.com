					<h4>Increasing accessibility for the next generation in science</h4>
					<p>Frontiers for Young Minds<span class="image right"><img src="https://jonathonkuntz.github.io/images/ffym2.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
				</header>
				<p>Frontiers for Young Minds (FFYM) is a kids journal specifically geared towards simplifying your science down for ages 8-15. The best part? Kids are the reviewers! Within the journal there are collections for different fields. My colleagues and I published a Core Concept (i.e., explains fundamental ideas from a field) paper in FFYM's San Francisco Bay collection to increase accessibility and understanding for kids learning about estuarine fish life history strategies in the Bay Area. <a href="https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2021.608881">Find the article here</a>.</p></p>

					<p>Bobcat STEM Academy</p>
				</header>
				<p>Under of the University of California's Science and Math Initiative (SMI), the <i>CalTeach</i> program is designed to address the shortage of STEM teachers in California’s elementary, middle, and secondary school systems. Under the umbrella of the <i>CalTeach</i> program, UC Merced organizes their own <i>Bobcat STEM Academy</i>, which offers summer STEM educational sessions to middle schoolers of California’s Central Valley. The Kim lab group, including myself, develops and teaches a yearly <i>Shark Survivor</i> module on shark paleo and modern ecology, as well as shark physiology in a changing climate.</p>
