					<h4>Increasing accessibility for the next generation in science</h4>
					<p>Frontiers for Young Minds<span class="image right"><img src="https://jonathonkuntz.github.io/images/ffym2.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
				</header>
				<p>Frontiers for Young Minds (FFYM) is a kids journal specifically geared towards simplifying your science down for ages 8-15. The best part? Kids are the reviewers! Within the journal there are collections for different fields. My colleagues and I published a Core Concept (i.e., explains fundamental ideas from a field) paper in FFYM's San Francisco Bay collection to increase accessibility and understanding for kids learning about estuarine fish life history strategies in the Bay Area. <a href="https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2021.608881">Find the article here</a>.</p></p>

					<p>Bobcat STEM Academy</p>
				</header>
				<p>Under of the University of California's Science and Math Initiative (SMI), the <i>CalTeach</i> program is designed to address the shortage of STEM teachers in California’s elementary, middle, and secondary school systems. Under the umbrella of the <i>CalTeach</i> program, UC Merced organizes their own <i>Bobcat Summer STEM Academy</i>, which offers summer STEM educational sessions to K-12 students of California’s Central Valley. The Kim lab group, including myself, develops and teaches a yearly <i>Shark Survivor</i> module to middle schoolers on ocean chemistry, shark physiology, and paleo/modern shark ecology. <a href="https://calteach.ucmerced.edu/bobcat-summer-stem-academy">Find information on the <i>Bobcat Summer STEM Academy</i> here</a>.</p></p>

				<p>While social media was not originally intended for scientific purposes, the scientific community has found a niche on social media platforms (i.e., twitter, instagram, etc.) by communicating their science in innovative ways and bridging the knowledge gap between scientists and the public. In addition, scientists also share their findings with other scientists on social media platforms, allowing an up-to-date dissemination of knowledge and increased connection for collaborative efforts across the globe. I regularly engage in science communication on twitter (<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/shark_eye_sci">@shark_eye_sci</a>) and try to share new findings and answer anyone’s questions about shark ecology. Tweet me your awesome shark questions!!!</p>
